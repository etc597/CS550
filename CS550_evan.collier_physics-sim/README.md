# Running the Simulation
1. Open the Bin Directory
2. Double click the application
3. The simulation should now be running

# Building the Simulation
1. You will need to install cmake 3.6 or newer (https://cmake.org/download/)
2. After installing cmake, open a command prompt in the top level project directory (should be the highest level directory containing a CMakeLists.txt file)
3. run mkdir build
4. cd build
5. cmake ..
6. this should generate a visual studio solution called physics-sim.sln
7. Open the solution and build in release for the highest performance (Publish won't run)

# Notes
All of my physics files are in src/Physics
